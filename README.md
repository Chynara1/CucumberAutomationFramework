Automated Testing Framework README
Overview
Welcome to our Automated Testing Framework built using Maven! This repository houses a robust framework designed for automated testing of web applications. Leveraging industry-standard tools and best practices, our framework provides a scalable and maintainable solution for testing web applications.

Features
Maven Integration: Utilizes Maven for streamlined project management and dependency resolution. The pom.xml file contains all project dependencies, including Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, and WebDriverManager.
Page Object Model (POM) Design Pattern: Organizes web elements into separate page classes for improved maintainability and scalability. Each page class encapsulates the behavior and elements of a specific web page.
Utilities Folder: Contains reusable methods and utilities to enhance framework functionality and promote code reusability.
ConfigReader: Reads configuration properties from configReader.properties files.
BrowserUtils: Provides reusable methods like hoverOver, TakeAScreenshot, and selectDropDownByValue.
TestBase: Manages setup and teardown operations with Before and After methods for initializing and closing the WebDriver instance.
Tests Package: Contains all test classes and methods organized for easy execution. Utilizes TestNG and testng.xml for configuring test classes and groups for automation suite execution.
Getting Started
To get started with our Automated Testing Framework, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
Ensure you have Maven installed on your system.
Customize the configReader.properties file with your application's specific configuration settings.
Navigate to the project directory and run tests using Maven commands or your preferred IDE.
Usage
Our framework is designed to provide a seamless testing experience for web applications. Simply create new test classes in the tests package, utilize the provided utilities and page classes, and configure test execution using TestNG and testng.xml.
